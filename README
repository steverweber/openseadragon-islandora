== OpenSeadragon

This project is a fork of the OpenSeadragon project at http://openseadragon.codeplex.com/

We are forking it primarily to do heavy clean-up on the code base, simplify the build, and see what happens from there.

== Building from Source

Building from source is easy with 'ant'.  The result is included in the 
distribution as 'openseadragon.js', the version being recording in the header.
